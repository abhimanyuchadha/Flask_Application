# Flask_Application

Application developed using Python 2.7 and flask framework.
Can be hosted behind Apache, mod_wsgi or can be run as standalone application.
The client side is developed using HTML, Javascript, CSS, Bootstrap.

It calculates all the permutaions of the entered string. For eg. all the permutations of "ABC" will be "ABC", "ACB", "BAC", "BCA", "CAB" and "CBA".

This is just to learn flask framework and building microservices using python.
